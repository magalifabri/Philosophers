0) Philo_one code

- Check the code of philo_one for the following things and ask for explanation.
- Check if there is one thread per philosopher.
- Check if there is a mutex per fork and that it's used to check the fork value and/or change it.
- Check if the output is protected against multiple access. To avoid a scrambled view.
- Check how the death of a philosopher is checked and if there is a mutex to protect that a philosopher dies and eats at the same time.


1) Philo_one test

- Do not test with more than 200 philosphers
- Do not test with time_to_die or time_to_eat or time_to_sleep under 60 ms
- Test with 5 800 200 200, no one should die!
- Test with 4 410 200 200, no one should die!
- Test with 4 310 200 100, a philosopher should die!
- Test with 2 philosophers and check the different times (a death delayed by more than 10 ms is unacceptable).
- Test your own values to check all the rules. Check if a philosopher dies at the right time, if they don't steal forks, etc.


2) Philo_two code

- Check the code of philo_two for the following things and ask for explanation.
- Check if there is one thread per philosopher.
- Check if there is a single semaphore that represents the number of forks.
- Check if the output is protected against multiple access. To avoid a scrambled view.
- Check how the death of a philosopher is checked and if there is a semaphore to protect that a philosopher dies and eat at the same time.

4) Philo_three code

- Check the code of philo_three for the following things and ask for explanation.
- Check if there will be one process per philosopher and that the first process waits for all of them.
- Check if there is a single semaphore that represent the number of forks.
- Check if the output is protected against multiple access. To avoid a scrambled view.
- Check how the death of a philosopher is checked and if there is a semaphore to protect that a philosopher dies and eats at the same time.
